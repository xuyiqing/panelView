## Visualizing Panel Data
---

**Description:** panelView visualizes panel data. panelView has two main functionalities: (1) it visualizes the treatment and missing-value statuses of each observation in a panel/time-series-cross-sectional (TSCS) dataset; and (2) it plots the outcome variable (either continuous or discrete) in a time-series fashion.

We develop this package in the belief that it is always a good idea to better understand your data before conducting statistical analyses.
