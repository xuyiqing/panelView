## Visualizing Panel Data with Dichotomous Treatments
---

**Description:** panelView visualizes panel data with dichotomous treatments. panelView has two main functionalities: (1) it visualizes the treatment and missing-value statuses of each observation in a panel/time-series-cross-sectional (TSCS) dataset; and (2) it plots the outcome variable (either continuous or discrete) in a time-series fashion.

We believe it's always a good idea to check out the raw data before conducting any statistical analysis!
