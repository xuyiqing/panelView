## Visualizing Panel Data
---

**Description:** panelview visualizes panel data. It has three main functionalities: 

(1) it visualizes the treatment and missing-value statuses of each observation in a panel dataset;

(2) it plots the outcome variable (either continuous or discrete) in a time-series fashion;

(3) it visualizes the relationships between the outcome and treatment variable individually or in an aggregate fashion.

We develop this package in the belief that it is always a good idea to better understand your data before conducting statistical analyses.
